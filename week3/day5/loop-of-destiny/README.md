# Loop Of Destiny Project

- The game runs inside a while (health > 0) loop, meaning each turn repeats as long as the player is alive.
- At the start of every turn, the player’s and enemy’s stats are displayed.
- The player chooses to either Attack (costs energy) or Rest (regains energy).
- If the enemy survives the turn, it attacks back and reduces the player’s health.
- When an enemy is defeated, a stronger enemy spawns and the player gains stat boosts.
- The game ends when the player’s health reaches 0 or below, triggering a Game Over screen and displaying the final score.
